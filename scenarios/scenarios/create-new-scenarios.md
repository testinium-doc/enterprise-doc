# Create New Scenarios

It is the screen where a new scenario definition is made in the system. Before this process, Project Name must be selected on the listing screen. Otherwise, the system gives an error message that the new scenario operation cannot be performed without selecting a project name. The system also applies filtering on the listing screen according to the selected project name.
